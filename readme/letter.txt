Repba makes high resolution images viewable on small screens.  Rather than
resizing the image to fit the width of the screen, Repbaview displays only a
portion of the image, resized to the height of the screen.  The entire image is
drawn virtually beyond the screen boundaries and is pannable in all directions.
This is a perfect solution for high detail, high resolution images and can be
used in any web page that supports iframes.  

Repbaview can display high
resolution images on small screens with no reduction in quality.  With
Repbaview,  images can now be panned virtually at the original image quality. 
Repbaview does not sacrifice image quality for screen size.

Repbaview organizes images into collections for easy exploration and discovery
with its visual menu. The  visual menu has a thumbnail for each image and is
scrollable across large numbers of images.   The visual menu can be extended
with links to non-image related external documents.

Repbaview allows large high-resolution images to be panned virtually with its
virtual thumbnail.  The thumbnail shows the portion of the larger image currently
in view.

Repbview can be both automated with slideshows and inserted into web pages. 
With Repbaview, portions of images can be linked to directly.  Repbaview
converts the image into a first class linkable web resource.  

Repbaview is a
very capable hi-resolution image viewer for the most demanding imaging
applications.  Visit repba.com for more information or contact us at
